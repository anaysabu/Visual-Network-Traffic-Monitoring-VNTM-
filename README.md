# Visual-Network-Traffic-Monitoring-VNTM-
This project converts network packet capture (PCAP) files into KML format, enabling users to visualize network traffic geographically on platforms like Google Earth. It helps security analysts, researchers, and network engineers better understand data flow, identify threats, and gain insights into network activity through a user-friendly interface.
